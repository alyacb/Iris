<h3> Summary </h3>
<p> What is Iris, you ask? Iris is a foray into NLP and ML. The plan is to use graphs and statistical analysis to create 
an 'AI' capable of learning, understanding, and replicating, human speech. </p>
<p> Thus far, I have successfully implemented graphs that can store a variety of types, and interfaces to manipulate 
and store them, with functionality ranging from randomly generating a connected graph with an arbitrary number of nodes,
to storing sentences and words in a graph, such that consecutive words are adjacent nodes. </p>
<p> I have recently been focusing on developing the base for allowing Iris to statistically analyze a data-set. </p>
</br>

<h3> Trivia </h3>
<p> In Greek mythology, Iris was the goddess of rainbows. This is a coincidentally fitting name, since I
 have, sporadically, implemented color schemes (e.g. nodes, bar graphs) determined by random number generation,
 which results in a few colorful user interface elements. </p>
<p> However, I feel it necessary to mention that the name Iris was based on the U2 song by the same name. </p>
