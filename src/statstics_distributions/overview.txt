These are the basic mathematical distributions known by Iris' statistical engine.
Their primary purpose is for testing the accuracy of Iris' distribution-matching algorithms.

Implementation notes:
- New implementation of previous distributions, 
owing to the disorganized nature of the previous versions of the classes.
